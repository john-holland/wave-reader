Suggested Improvements for the ProxyMachine Background Script
1. Enhanced ProxyMachine with Performance Monitoring
Add execution time tracking for methods
Include success/failure metrics
Better async method handling
Method call analytics
2. Message Queue System
Implement a message queue for handling concurrent requests
Add priority-based message processing
Retry logic for failed messages
Message deduplication
3. State Management Integration
Connect with the structural system's state management
Add state persistence across service worker restarts
Implement state synchronization between components
4. Error Recovery & Resilience
Circuit breaker pattern for failing operations
Automatic retry with exponential backoff
Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
Health check endpoints
5. Security Enhancements
Message validation and sanitization
Origin verification for messages
Rate limiting for message processing
Content Security Policy compliance
6. Integration with Structural System
Use the actual RobotCopy and ProxyMachine from log-view-machine
Connect with the WaveReaderMessageRouter
Implement proper tome integration
Add structural system event handling
7. Developer Experience
Better debugging tools and logging
Performance profiling capabilities
Message flow visualization
Development vs production modes
8. Testing & Reliability
Unit tests for all message handlers
Integration tests with content scripts
Mock Chrome APIs for testing
Automated health monitoring
Would you like me to implement any of these specific improvements? I'd recommend starting with #6 (Integration with Structural System) since that would align with the overall architecture we've been building, or #1 (Enhanced ProxyMachine) for better observability.
